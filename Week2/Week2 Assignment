# Machine Learning Mastery Assignment

## Instructions

### Objective
Implement and analyze various machine learning algorithms discussed in the lecture.

### Submission Format
Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb).

### Total Marks
50.

### Submission Deadline
February 16th, 2024.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Data Preparation (5 Marks)
- Load a dataset of your choice.
- Perform necessary data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

### Task 2: Supervised Learning (20 Marks)
- **Part A:** Choose one supervised learning algorithm (e.g., Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, or Neural Networks) and train it on the dataset.
- **Part B:** Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- **Part C:** Compare the performance of at least two different supervised learning algorithms on the same dataset.

### Task 3: Unsupervised Learning (15 Marks)
- **Part A:** Apply an unsupervised learning algorithm (e.g., K-Means Clustering or Hierarchical Clustering) to identify patterns or clusters in the dataset.
- **Part B:** Visualize the clusters and interpret the results.
- **Part C:** Discuss the advantages and limitations of using unsupervised learning in this scenario.

### Task 4: Application in Predictive Analytics (10 Marks)
- Choose one predictive analytics application (e.g., sales forecasting or customer churn prediction).
- Build a machine learning model to address the chosen application.
- Evaluate the model's performance and discuss the practical implications.

### Bonus Task (Extra 5 Marks)
- Implement an additional machine learning algorithm of your choice and compare its performance with the existing models.

## Note
- Plagiarism will not be tolerated. Ensure that the assignment is your original work.
